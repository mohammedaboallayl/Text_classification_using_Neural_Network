# Text Classification Using Neural Network built from scratch
Text classification depends on separating between spam and not spam emails using Neural Network created from scratch
it's depending on creating a dictionary of words for making our vector which express our phrase but in numbers so neural network can deal with 
# Neural Network shape 
our neural network dont have any hidden layers for fast training and to avoid overfit 
its initial weights has been assigned to a random array of numbers between 0 and 0.1 for making it faster in training as you will see the graph at the end of Jubyter notbook
